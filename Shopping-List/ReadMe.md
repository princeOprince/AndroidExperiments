# Coding Challenge #

### Challenge: ### 
      Create a simple shopping-list app with a main activity for the list the user is building,
      and a second activity for a list of common shopping items.
      
      ● The main activity should contain the list to build, which should be made up of ten empty
        TextView elements.
      ● An Add Item button on the main activity launches a second activity that contains a list of
        common shopping items (Cheese, Rice, Apples, and so on). Use Button elements to display
        the items.
      ● Choosing an item returns the user to the main activity, and updates an empty TextView to
        include the chosen item.
        
      Use an Intent to pass information from one Activity to another. Make sure that the current state
      of the shopping list is saved when the user rotates the device.
